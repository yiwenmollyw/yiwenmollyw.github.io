<i>HCI, Aging, Accessibility, Personal Informatics</i>

Hi, I am a third-year PhD candidate in the College of Information at the University of Maryland, College Park, advised by [Dr. Eun Kyoung Choe](https://terpconnect.umd.edu/~choe/). I received a Master’s degree in Human-Computer Interaction under the guidance of [Dr. Roshan Peiris](https://www.ritairlab.org/) and worked as a research assistant with [Dr. Kristen Shinohara](https://www.kristenshinohara.com/) and [Dr. Mingming Fan](https://www.mingmingfan.com/) at the Rochester Institute of Technology. I am a member of the [Human-Computer Interaction Lab](https://hcil.umd.edu/) and a former member of the [Center for Accessibility and Inclusion Research](https://cair.rit.edu/).

My work focuses on exploring technologies to collect and share personal health information among underrepresented populations. My work informs strategies that enable, empower, and engage older adults and people with disabilities as data collectors and consumers in AI-driven personal informatics systems.

<!-- You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

<h2> Current Research </h2>

I am working on a “[teachable activity tracker](https://mymove-collective.github.io/)” project aimed to support older adults and people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia in the data labeling to train their personalized activity trackers.
